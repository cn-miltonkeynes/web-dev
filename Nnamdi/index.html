<h1> Multiversus </h1>
<p> Multiversus is a cool game made by the famous Warner Bros. Althought the game is only a preview, it is still very popular. </p>
  <p> Since Multiversus was made by Warner bros, you can fight as characters from their shows! </p>
<p> I will be explaining the characters and how they are useful in a fight. </p>

<h1> Bugs Bunny </h1>
<p> Bugs Bunny is an iconic character but thats not the only reason I personally like to play as him. </p>
<p> Bugs Bunny has a lot of range and options resort to if you feel stuck in a corner. Those moves, if you use them right, can also be used to recover from devestating blows. </p>
<p> For example, Bugs Bunny can summon a rocket which can attack, but you can also ride on the rocket to avoid falling off the edge of the map. </p>
<p> Bugs Bunny is also a mage, meaning his projectile moves (like the rocket) deal more damage than his melee damage. This does not mean that the melee moves are weak it just means he is stronger with the projectile moves. </p>

<h1> Garnet </h1>
<p> Garnet is a good starter for if you are just starting the game. Her move set is quite simple and easy to use and she is one of the recommended characters. </p>
<p> Garnet is also a good character for recovery. One of her special moves summons a star. If you do the move again while the star is active, it will teleport you to the star  which is really good if your falling off the edge of the map.
</p>
<p> Garnet is also a bruiser character which means she is very good with dealing melee damage.</p> </div>

<div style = color:blue;>
<h1> Finn </h1>
<p>Finn is a good character for starting out. His move set is similar to garnet.</p>
<p> Finn has a special ability which allows him to open a shop. Dealing damage to a player will give you more coins to buy weapons from the shop.</p>
<p> The spinning backpack move is the most powerful move but it will lose you  coins, so you should be careful about using it. </p>
<p> Finn is also an assassin character which means he is very good with mobility and dealing a lot of damage, but he is very vulnerable to high damage attacks.</p> </div>

<h1> Taz</h1>
<p> Taz is really good character for dealing damage but not finishing.</p>
<p> He has a tornado move which is really good for dealing damage. He is very good for starting out</p>

<p> Batman is very good and i recommend him for people who are a little experienced with these type of games.</p>
