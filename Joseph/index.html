<p>I have played roblox since 2015 so obviously I am a mega professional. I have lots of expirience and I am very good in a very wide variety of games. I have the top tier in a game called MM2 (the picture below), Ninja legends and Demon Slayer RPG 2. </p>

<p> As i said before, the picture above is the thumbnail for MM2 (Murder Mystery 2). MM2 is a game with a Sherif, Innocents and a murderer. The murderer has a knife and kills Innocents. The sherif has a gun and has to shoot the murderer. If the murderer elliminates every player, they win. If the Sherif shoots the murderer in time, he wins along with the surviving innocents.</p>

<p> Above is old roblox. Roblox was founded in 2006 by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel. The avatars have changed from blocks to animations and emotes with a real-like feature to it. </p>
